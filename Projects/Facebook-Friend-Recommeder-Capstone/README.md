# Facebook Friend Recommender
- Built a recommender system of facebook friends based on network analysis using a dataset of nodes (users), user profile info. (attributes), and connections (edges)
- Performed network analysis using Node2Vec algorithm to understand graph structure and attributes of connections and give recommendations of potential friends to connect with
- Used NetworkX library link prediction metrics such common neighbors, jaccard coefficient, etc. and create a supervised learning model linking metric values to connection status to make predictions on which two unconnected nodes/users are most likely to be friends and give recommendations based on that probability
