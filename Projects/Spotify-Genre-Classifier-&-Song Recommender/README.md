# Spotify Genre Classifier & Song Recommender
- Built A ML pipeline that classifies a Spotify dataset of tracks into their appropriate genres and created a recommender that takes a track and integer K as input from the user and recommends the top K similar songs to the user input.
- Built supervised learning models that classify songs into their appropriate genre based on dataset of songs with a column genre and song attributes such as tempo, valence, etc.
- Used Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Linear Support Vector Machine Models with training set of song attributes and testing set of genre labels.
- Built functions to access and extract features from track data in the Spotify API given song data was not already present in the dataset.
- Created a recommender system for similar songs by creating a algorithm using euclidean distance to partially mimick a KNN type algorithm to select similar songs to user input.
