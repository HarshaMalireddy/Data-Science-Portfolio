# [Making Product Sales Projections with Time Series Forecasting](https://github.com/HarshaMalireddy/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Springboard%20Projects/Time%20Series%20Forecasting/Making%20Product%20Sales%20Projections%20with%20Time%20Series%20Forecasting.ipynb) 

- Built a time series arima model to predict cigarette sales from 1960-1970 given data of sales from 1949-1960
- Examined trend, seasonality, and residuals of data and tested for stationarity with the kpss function, before taking log to make data stationary and then create an arima model
